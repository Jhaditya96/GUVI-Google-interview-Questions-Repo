Fibonacci Representation of a Number
===================================

<h3>
Statement :
</h3>
Write a program to show Fibonacci representation of a given number.
Ex- 15 can be represented as 100010 (1*13+0*8+0*5+0*3+1*2+0*1)

<h3>
Algorithm :
<h3>
Go on finding largest fibonacci number which is smaller than the given number.
Subtract it from the number. And repeat the process for next smaller fibonacci number
on remainder.
