Binary Search Tree
==================

Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree with insert and search utilities.

<h4>
Algorithm :
</h4>

<h5>
Check if given binary tree is binary search tree.
</h5>
Check if left and right subtrees are BST. Also check minimum value of right subtree 
is larger than value stored at node and maximum value of left subtree is smaller
than value stored at node.
